= Introduction: The Hidden Cost of Infrastructure-as-a-Service

When infrastructure is self-service with no clear guardrails in place, problems can quickly emerge:

- Teams struggle to correctly request and size GPU resources
- Multiple teams may deploy identical models, duplicating effort
- Expensive GPUs remain idle or become overloaded
- Infrastructure costs escalate without clear accountability
- Developers need model access, not GPU management complexity

== Model-as-a-Service: A Better Abstraction for AI at Scale

To address these challenges as a platform engineer, you will design a centralized, reusable, and secure model-serving layer:

**Centralized Model Management**

* Platform teams deploy and maintain models with proper lifecycle management
* Versioning, rollbacks, and testing become standardized processes

**Secure API Gateway**

* All model access goes through authenticated, rate-limited endpoints
* Full observability and monitoring across all model interactions

**Developer-Friendly Access**

* Developers consume models without managing underlying hardware
* Teams focus on building applications, agents, and features powered by AI

**Efficient Resource Utilization**

* GPU resources are pooled and shared across the organization
* Eliminates waste while ensuring fair access and cost control

== Module 1 Goals: Step into the Developer role.

In this first module, you will take your first step into the role of a developer. You will access your OpenShift web console and get access to your model credentials that have been set up through a model as a service interface.
